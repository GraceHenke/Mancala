Percepts:
	Player One's Points
	Player Two's Points

Potential Actions: 
the potential actions are dependent on two things, first which agents turn it is, and second which holes are empty.
The first agent can only access holes 1-6 and the second agent can only access 7-13. If any of these holes are empty,they can't be choosen.
	
The Environment:
Observability: fully observable: the board, points 
Uncertainty: Deterministic. The movements will be exact, there will not be randomness to the movements.
Duration: Sequential. Actions need to happen in order. Takes multiple actions to reach the goal condition.
Stability: Dynamic. As each agent takes a turn the board changes, thus creating a dynamic environment.
Granularity: Discrete. All values are discrete. Ex. a stone is worth one, win/lose/tie
Participants: Multi-Agent. Since this a two player game, there will be two agents needed.
Knowledge: Known. the physics of the environment are known.there are no unknown of the environment
